# Power BI Project: Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard

## 🔧 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a data model and developing performance metrics using Power BI and DAX. The aim was to analyze sales and profitability trends while creating a clean, interactive dashboard experience.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
I started by cleaning the data in **each table** to ensure consistency and accuracy. This included:
- Removing duplicates
- Fixing data types
- Handling missing/null values
- Standardizing column names

---

## 🧩 Data Modeling
After cleaning, I built relationships between the tables to create a solid **data model**. This allowed seamless integration across dimensions and facts for accurate analysis.

In addition, I added a **calculated column** named:
- `COGS` *(Cost of Goods Sold)*

---

## 📐 DAX Measures
To enrich the analysis, I created several custom DAX measures:
- `Avg_Delivery_Duration` – Average time taken for delivery  
- `Profitability` – Margin calculation and profitability insight  
- `Sales Perf` – Sales performance tracking vs benchmarks  
- `Target` – Measure to compare actuals against set goals

## 📊 Dashboard Pages
The report contains **three main pages**:
1. **Sales Overview** – Total sales, top products, regional performance  
2. **Profit Analysis** – Profit trends, COGS breakdown, profitability insights  
3. **Details View** – Drill-through table with product-level performance
